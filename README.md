# 42-libft

## Overview
This is the first project from 42 School. It consists of several exercises—similar to those in the piscine—to revisit and consolidate the fundamentals of C programming. The project was validated at 125% (including bonus tasks).
Additionally, an add-ons directory was created to include extra functions that were gradually added during the common core C curriculum.

`ft_strmapi`: Applies a function to each character of a string and returns a new modified string.

`ft_strncmp`: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.

`ft_strnstr`: Searches for a substring within a string up to a given length.

`ft_strrchr`: Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.

`ft_strtrim`: Trims specified characters from the beginning and end of a string.

`ft_substr`: Extracts a substring from a string starting at a given index.

`ft_tolower`: Converts an uppercase letter to lowercase.

`ft_toupper`: Converts a lowercase letter to uppercase.

### Bonus Functions
`ft_lstnew`: Creates a new linked list node with the provided content.

`ft_lstadd_front`: Adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.

`ft_lstsize`: Counts and returns the number of nodes in a linked list.

`ft_lstadd_back`: Appends a new node to the end of a linked list.

`ft_lstlast`: Retrieves the last node in a linked list.

`ft_lstdelone`: Deletes a single linked list node using a specified function to free its content.

`ft_lstclear`: Deletes and frees all nodes in a linked list.

`ft_lstiter`: Iterates over each node in a linked list and applies a function to its content.

`ft_lstmap`: Creates a new linked list by applying a function to each node’s content from an existing list.

### Add-on Functions
`free_tab`: Frees a dynamically allocated array of strings.

`free_tab_int`: Frees a two-dimensional array of integers, given its size.

`free_tab_void`: Frees a dynamically allocated array of pointers (void**).

`ft_count`: Returns the number of digits in an integer.

`ft_count_long`: Returns the number of digits in a long integer.

`ft_count_ul`: Returns the number of digits in an unsigned long integer.

`ft_count_unsigned`: Returns the number of digits in an unsigned integer.

`ft_putchar`: Outputs a single character to the standard output.

`ft_putnbr`: Outputs an integer to the standard output.

`ft_putnbr_base`: Outputs an integer in a specified numeral base.

`ft_putnbr_base_ul`: Outputs an unsigned long integer in a specified numeral base.

`ft_putunbr`: Outputs an unsigned integer to the standard output.

`ft_putstr`: Outputs a string to the standard output.

`ft_strcmp`: Compares two strings and returns the difference between the first pair of differing characters.

`ft_strcpy`: Copies a string from a source to a destination buffer.

`ft_strncpy`: Copies up to a specified number of characters from a source string to a destination.

`ft_strlen_doublechar`: Computes the number of strings in an array of strings (a double pointer).

`ft_swap_int`: Swaps the values of two integers.

`ft_atoi_base`: Converts a string representing a number in a given base to its integer value.

`ft_printf`: A custom implementation of the printf function for formatted output.

`get_next_line`: Reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it as a string.
